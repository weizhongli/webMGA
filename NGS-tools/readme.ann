Note about coverage, abundance in COG, KOG, PRK, PFAM annotation

For cog.txt, kog.txt, prk.txt, and pfam.txt
Coverage: the sum of total alignment length / length of reference protein for all non-overlapping top hits.
Abundance: normalized coverage, which add up to 1.0

For cog-class.txt, kog-class.txt, and prk-class.txt
Coverage: fraction of protein families in the function class who got hit. 
  So, the example below means that 85.6% of the 320 kog families in class J were found.
Abundance: the sum of abundance of the kog families in this class. 
  Since one kog family may below to multiple classes, the sum of abundance in this file can be greater than 1.0

## example kog-class.txt
#Class No_families Coverage Abundance Description
J      320         0.85625  0.07011   Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis
